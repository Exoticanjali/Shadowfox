ðŸ“Š Superstore Sales Analysis â€“ ShadowFox Internship

This project was developed during my **ShadowFox Internship** with the objective of performing a comprehensive analysis of the *Superstore dataset* to derive meaningful insights for business decision-making. Using Python, I carried out data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and report generation to highlight sales and profit trends.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

The dataset contains information on sales, profit, discount, customer segments, categories, sub-categories, and regions. The project aimed to answer key business questions such as:

* Which categories and sub-categories drive the most sales?
* How do discounts affect profitability?
* Which regions and customer segments contribute most to profit?
* What are the monthly sales and profit trends?

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

ðŸ”¹ Key Insights

* **Discounts**: High discounts reduce profitability despite boosting sales.
* **Regions**: The West and East are more profitable compared to the South and Central.
* **Categories**: Technology and Office Supplies drive sales, while Furniture shows lower margins.
* **Sub-Categories**: Phones and Chairs lead in sales; Tables show losses.
* **Customer Segments**: Corporate and Consumer segments are more profitable than Home Office.
* **Monthly Trends**: Sales peak during year-end, with fluctuating profits.
* **Sales vs. Profit**: Not all high sales translate into high profit, highlighting margin issues.

ðŸ”¹ Deliverables

* 8 Key Visualizations:

  1. Sales vs. Profit
  2. Profit by Region
  3. Sales by Category
  4. Sales by Sub-Category
  5. Discount Impact on Profit
  6. Monthly Sales Trend
  7. Monthly Profit Trend
  8. Sales vs. Profit by Customer Segment

This project demonstrates how **data analytics transforms raw data into actionable insights** for business strategy. The findings can guide decisions on discount strategies, regional focus, and product portfolio optimization.
